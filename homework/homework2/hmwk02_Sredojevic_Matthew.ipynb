    "This assignment is due on Moodle by **5pm on Friday February 16th**. Your solutions to theoretical questions should be done in Markdown/MathJax directly below the associated question.  Your solutions to computational questions should include any specified Python code and results as well as written commentary on your conclusions.  Remember that you are encouraged to discuss the problems with your instructors and classmates, but **you must write all code and solutions on your own**.  For a refresher on the course **Collaboration Policy** click [here](https://github.com/chrisketelsen/csci3022/blob/master/resources/syllabus.md#collaboration-policy).  \n",

    "- Some problems with code may be autograded.  If we provide a function API please do not change it.  If we do not provide a function API then you're free to structure your code however you like. \n",
    "- It is **bad form** to make your reader interpret numerical output from your code.  If a question asks you to compute some value from the data you should show your code output **AND** write a summary of the results in Markdown directly below your code.\n",
    "- Because you can technically evaluate notebook cells is a non-linear order, it's a good idea to do Cell $\\rightarrow$ Run All as a check before submitting your solutions.  That way if we need to run your code you will know that it will work as expected. \n",

    "Dan, Kyle, and Sofie have been playing board games for ages. Among the games they play a lot are Miniopoly and a similar game with slightly tweaked rules called **Fakeiopoly!**  Being Data-Nerds, they like to record the details of each game they play for future analysis.  Since the games are similar, they store the results for Miniopoly and Fakeiopoly in the same database.  Unfortunately, their data has been corrupted!  The only data that survived are the states (i.e. square numbers) they were on after each of the first 20 turns as well a the amount of cash they had on hand after each of the first 20 turns. This information is stored in the columns **S1**-**S20** and **C1**-**C20** in the following DataFrame. "

    "My initial thought was that there would be a different jail in the fake games as opposed to, so to do that, i check every Column (s1-s20) until some column is equal to what is in front of it, but jail was initiall to uncommon to make this a strong enough prediction and it actually makes my accuracy worse (from .488 to 484). After someone mentioned looking at the whole dataset (through github) i noticed that square 31 looked to be the jail location and changed the code to specify the location of 31 and did not worry if the cash was 0 or not. **However**, there is the possibility that in the first game, a player was on space 31 and went bankrupt, so if we DO check the cash at that spot and see that it is not 0, it should be more likely to be a fake game. The next thing that came to mind was if one or more of the die were not normal 6 sided die (maybe one's a D12, Dan talked about those in class one day). So to confirm this, i created an array of average rolls per game and checked if that was between 6.5 and 7.5 (a bit of buffer for those other vaules) and said that if it was, then it was real. \n",
